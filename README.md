# RNN based prediction of customer attrition
This is the submission by my team, "KOALACODERS", for the final round of the data analytics competition **"Data Storm 1.0"** by OCTAVE.

## Problem

### Use Case definition
Identify customers who will completely stop shopping at the supermarket (i.e. basket
value drops to 0) in the next 2 consecutive months.
For example - the customer who have shopped in January 2019 but not in
February 2019 and March 2019 is identified as a churn case.

### Business Problem
The sales and marketing team needs to identify high risk customers before
they churn, to make targeted proactive interventions to ensure continued
business.
Current efforts to reduce customer churn are reactive (i.e. offers are targeted
towards churned customers who have not returned to the business for a few
months) . These efforts have not been regular in response to specific situations
(eg- store re-fitting)

### Key question to answer
Which regular customers (clue â€“ define regularity by looking at average
monthly transaction frequency and tenure of the customer) are most likely to
stop shopping at the supermarket?
